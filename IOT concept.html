<p>Kevin Ashton firstly proposed the concept of IoT in 1999, and he referred the IoT as uniquely identifiable interoperable connected objects with radio-frequency identification (RFID) technology. However, the exact definition of IoT is still in the forming process that is subject to the perspectives taken (Hepp et al. 2007; Joshi and Kim 2013; Pretz 2013). IoT was generally defined as “dynamic global network infrastructure with self-configuring capabilities based on standards and interoperable communication protocols; physical and virtual ‘things’ in an IoT have identities and attributes and are capable of using intelligent interfaces and being integrated as an information network” (IERC 2013; Kirtsis 2011; Li et al. 2012a, b). Basically, the IoT can be treated as a superset of connecting devices that are uniquely identifiable by existing near field communication (NFC) techniques (ETSI 2013). The words “Internet” and “Things” mean an inter-connected world-wide network based on sensory, communication, networking, and information processing technologies, which might be the new version of information and communications technology (ICT) (Kranenburg 2013; Marry 2013).Despite the argument on the definition of IoT, it has been discussed widely and corresponding technologies have been rapidly developed by various institutions (Guo et al. 2012; Hepp et al. 2007; ITU 2013; Li et al. 2013b; Pretz 2013); in particular, intelligent sensing and wireless communication techniques have become part of the IoT and new challenges and research horizons have emerged (Hunter et al. 2012; Wilamowski 2010).  The International Telecommunication Union (ITU) discussed the enabling technologies, potential markets, and emerging challenges and the implications of the IoT (Frenken et al. 2008; ITU 2013). The evolvement of IoT can be illustrated by several phases as shown in Fig. 1. The IoT is initiated by the use of RFID technology, which is increasingly used in logistics, pharmaceutical production, retail, and diverse industries (Fielding and Taylor 2002; Guinard et al. 2010; Guinard et al. 2009; Xu 2011b). </p></body>
