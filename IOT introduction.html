<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>Pretz has indicated that the Internet of things (IoT) is a things-connected network, where things are wirelessly connected via smart sensors (Pretz 2013); IoT is able to interact without human intervention. Some preliminary IoT applications have been already developed in healthcare, transportation, and automotive industries (He et al. 2014; Joshi and Kim 2013; Pretz 2013). Currently, IoT technologies are at their infant stages; however, many new developments have occurred in the integration of objects with sensors in the cloud-based Internet (Hepp et al. 2007; Joshi and Kim 2013; Pretz 2013).The development of IoT involves many issues such as infrastructure, communications, interfaces, protocols, and standards. We are motivated to summarize the research progress achieved so far in the development, standardization, and security assurance of IoT enabling technologies,and to identify critical research topics and future research directions of IoT.The rest of the paper is organized as follows:Section 1 mainly provides an overview of the definitions, current research, standards, and future research of IoT. In Section 2, the current research on IoT system architecture is discussed. In Section 3, the enabling technologies of IoT are investigated. In Section 4, the applications of IoT are reviewed. Finally, some emerging research issues are identified and the future research directions are discussed.</p>
